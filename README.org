  A repo for start learning Go with one of the things i want to use in other projects:

  This will be a Key generator for RSA512 keys pairs:

  The string for generating the keys is a random 4096 bit from crypt/rand.

  The keys will be created in the file and directory specified.

  Im not learned in Crypto so this is a concept of understanding the concepts.

* Usage:
